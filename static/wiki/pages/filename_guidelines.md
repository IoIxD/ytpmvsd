# Filename Guidelines

There are no strict rules to the way you name your samples, you can use whatever name you wish. However, for consistency
and ease of searching, there's a general set of guidelines you should follow.

## The Formula

There's a simple `A_B(_C).mp4` formula for naming your samples. A is the person/character/object making the noise in the
sample. B is the sound itself, either the sound they're vocalizing or the noise they make. C is optional and is any
extra meta
information about the sample. Remember A, B, and C, as they will be mentioned repeatedly throughout this article.

Here's a few examples:

| **nozomi_hihat.mp4**                                                                                  | **btmc_it_cf.mp4**                                                                                     |
| <small>A is nozomi, B is the hihat.</small>                                                           | <small>A is BTMC, B is the sound he's making (iiiiiit), and C is is "cf", meaning "crossfade".</small> |

If it wasn't a particular person/character that made the sound, you can use the source as A instead.

Numbering samples like `diy_snare2.mp4` could work as well, but it doesn't make them stand on their own as well.</small> |

### YTPMVSD v20250306

### <span style="color:green">New features</span>
#### ðŸ†• Changelog!
It's what you're reading right now :) This should make it easier to keep up on when I'm updating the site and when I get new features implemented! You can click the Kill Clop button below and it won't show again until the next update.
#### ðŸ“™ Wiki pages!
There's only [one so far](/wiki/filename_guidelines), but this should be a helpful way to add information about different parts of the site. In the future, maybe this could even expand to something larger ðŸ‘€

### <span style="color:orange">Changes</span>
#### ðŸ“¤ Multiple uploads!
You can now upload multiple files at once! This should make it a lot easier to upload your existing sample packs onto the site. The limit is currently set at 10 samples at a time for testing, but that'll probably be lifted in the future if it goes well.

### <span style="color:red">Bug fixes</span>
- Sample filenames now no longer overwrite each other.<br><small>(This one really required a near rewrite of the entire upload functions...)</small>
- Some hardcoding that led to broken pages is now unhardcoded.

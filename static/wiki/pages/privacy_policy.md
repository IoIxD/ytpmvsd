## Introduction
YTPMVSD is a website that allows users to upload and share short video clips used in YTPMVs. Users must create accounts to share these, and as such, YTPMVSD must collect, store, and transmit personal information. This privacy policy will describe what information we collect, how we use it, and how you are able to control your information.

## What We Collect
### On Registration
While users are able to browse the website and use all read-only features without an account, registration is required for some features to be available. When registering for an account, we store:

- Your username
- Your email address
- Your password

This information, excluding your username, is never shared publicly.

[//]: # (All user profiles, and the content within, are publicly visible to other users. Any of the above can be removed permanently by editing your profile.)

### On Uploading Content
When uploading content to our website such as a sample, it is shown publicly to all users. In all cases, you are able to permanently delete your uploads freely by accessing the page for the sample.

## Disclosure of Your Data
As there are no ads on the website, and we don't provide anything to purchase, we do not perform any marketing or advertising through email or any other means. The only emails you may receive from us are the result of an action done on the website such as:

- Confirmation after registering an account
- Password changes

We never share your personal information with any third parties.

## Control of Your Data
As a user, you have the right to update your personal information at any time. This can currently be done by emailing us at privacy@ytpmvsd.com. In addition, you are free to delete any samples you have uploaded to the site by visiting the sample page in question.

You also have the ability to delete your account permanently by sending a request to the aforementioned email address. Please note that by default, your uploaded samples will remain on the website unless manually deleted, or you specify you would like all your samples deleted.

## Cookies
We strictly use necessary cookies to maintain your session data and login credentials across sessions.
